# Homebrew formula for Agix AOS — `brew install agix-aos`.
#
# Installs the Agix AOS runtime tree (the `agix` CLI + the agent fleet + lib +
# vendored prod deps) into libexec and exposes `agix` on PATH. Produced by
# scripts/release/build-agix-tarball.sh; the public-clean gate runs at build time.
#
# PUBLISH (operator-gated): set `url`/`homepage` to the real public release host,
# keep `sha256` in sync with the published tarball (the build script prints both),
# add a matching root LICENSE, then push this formula to the public tap
# (e.g. `brew tap blewis-maker/agix && brew install agix-aos`). See scripts/release/README.md.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Agix AOS runs autonomous AI agents that act on your machine — they can read
      and write files and run commands. Review agents before running them; agents
      marked "executor" have the most capability.

      • No API key? Agix uses your installed Claude Code / Codex CLI — so running
        agents makes real model calls that count against THAT account's usage.
      • Local-only: state lives in ~/.config/agix and ~/.local/state/agix. No telemetry.
      • Platform: macOS supported; Linux is beta (unverified end-to-end).

      Get started:  agix
      Uninstall:    brew uninstall agix-aos  &&  agix uninstall --purge-state
    EOS

  test do
    assert_match "agix #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/agix --version")
