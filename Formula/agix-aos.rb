# Homebrew formula for Agix AOS — `brew install agix-aos`.
#
# Installs the Agix AOS runtime tree (the `agix` CLI + the agent fleet + lib +
# vendored prod deps) into libexec and exposes `agix` on PATH. Produced by
# scripts/release/build-agix-tarball.sh; the public-clean gate runs at build time.
#
# PUBLISH (operator-gated): set `url`/`homepage` to the real public release host,
# keep `sha256` in sync with the published tarball (the build script prints both),
# add a matching root LICENSE, then push this formula to the public tap
# (e.g. `brew tap agix-aos/agix && brew install agix-aos`). See scripts/release/README.md.
